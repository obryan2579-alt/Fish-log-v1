## Important notes
This is a test version. Data is saved in your browser's local storage. That means it stays on the device/browser you use unless you clear browser data.

The map uses free public map tiles for testing. A production app may need a paid or licensed map/depth-contour provider depending on your needs.

# Run locally
Open `index.html` in a browser. For best mobile testing, publish it with GitHub Pages using the steps below.
